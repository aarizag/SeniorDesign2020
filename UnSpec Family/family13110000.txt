"foams.  polyurethane foam. a type of porous plastic material known as foamrubber.  it is formed by an addition of bubbles, basically due to the chemical reaction of two components: polyol and isocyanate, its formulation needs and admits multiple variants and additives. such reaction releases carbon dioxide, gas that forms bubbles. it has several uses, some of them are: main filling or integrating of matress cushioning, sofa and chair seats; in construction as thermal insulator or filling; in automotive industry and in man. "
"foams.  ethylene vinyl acetate foam. a type of foam made from ethylene vinyl acetate eva, a thermoplastic polymer.  it is also known by its english commercial name, foamy, formed by repetitive units of ethylene and vinyl acetate.  it is employed in designs, school works, show industry, scenography and theater, educational and creative crafts, children playgrounds, occupational therapy, etc..
