"explosives.  white phosphorus. a material made from a common allotrope of the chemical element phosphorus that is used in smoke, tracer, illumination and incendiary munitions. white phosphorus is a translucent waxy solid that quickly becomes yellow when exposed to light. for this reason it is also called yellow phosphorus. it is highly flammable and pyrophoric (self-igniting) upon contact with air as well as toxic (causing severe liver damage on ingestion and phossy jaw from chronic ingestion or inhalation). the odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell. white phosphorus is only slightly soluble in water and it can be stored under water. indeed, white phosphorus is only safe from self-igniting when it is submerged in water. it is, however, soluble in benzene, oils, carbon disulfide, and disulfur dichloride.
