if you want to run the application run the file called 
compare_excels.py 

It will take some time to load and create everything.

At the moment, i havent made it work the deep compare. 

the excel file called narrowedsheets contains 250 sheets which has the commodity title and
commodity of the similar standards. Each one of these sheets is made with the higher
level of the Los Angeles County. Narrowing down the comparisons needed to be done.

The sheet name is the number code for the top level of the county standard. 

Once we get the results we can add them into the sheet.
